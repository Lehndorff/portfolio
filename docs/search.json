    "text": "There are three cards. One with two red sides, one with two black sides, one with a black side and a red site.\nA random card is placed in front of you – it has a red face. What are the odds that the other side of the card is black?\nIntuitively, I would expect the answer to be 50% – there are only two possible options red or black. Given that we are not looking at the black/black card the odds that the other side is black (this is the red/black card) and the odds that the other side is red (this is the red/red card) should be equally likely.\nThis is a simulation of this situation as a means of testing Bayes Theorem for conditional probabilities.\nFirst, there are six possibilities for how the cards could be oriented – each of the three card with one of two sides showing.\n\ncards<-data.frame(\n  card=1:6,\n  face=c(\"R\",\"R\",\"R\",\"B\",\"B\",\"B\"),\n  back=c(\"R\",\"R\",\"B\",\"R\",\"B\",\"B\"),\n  card_num=c(1,1,2,2,3,3),\n  orientation=rep(c(\"A\",\"B\"),3)\n  )\n\ncards\n\n  card face back card_num orientation\n1    1    R    R        1           A\n2    2    R    R        1           B\n3    3    R    B        2           A\n4    4    B    R        2           B\n5    5    B    B        3           A\n6    6    B    B        3           B\n\n\nThese cards can then be randomly sampled 1,000,000 times.\n\nsampled<-data.frame(card=sample(1:6,1000000,replace=T)) %>% \n  left_join(cards)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(card)`\n\n\nTo calculate the probability that the other side of the card is black given that we are looking at a red side, we first need to filter our random samples down to the cases where a red card is face up. Then count up the frequency with which black and red each appear as the back side of the card.\n\nsampled %>% \n  filter(face==\"R\") %>% \n  group_by(back) %>% \n  summarise(n=n()) %>% \n  mutate(pct=scales::percent(n/sum(n)))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  back       n pct  \n  <chr>  <int> <chr>\n1 B     166907 33%  \n2 R     333264 67%  \n\n\nRather than being the expected 50% probability, the odds of having the other side be black is only 1/3."

    "text": "If you haven’t seen it before, I highly recommend viewing the annual migration of Vaux’s swifts at Chapman Elementary in northwest Portland. On evenings in the fall, up to 10,000 swifts roost in the chimney of the school. Their movements, when assembled, are very similar to that of starling groupings in Europe. According to research from Princeton University, these formations are based on each individual bird trying to track the location of only seven other birds.\nEver since seeing the swifts the first time, I thought it would be fun to simulate the behavior of these birds. This interactive graphic is an animation that gives an overhead view of a simulation of 50 randomly placed birds. Each bird is trying to move to the midpoint of its seven nearest neighbors. Each frame of the simulation represents one ‘moment’ in which each bird attempts to re-calibrate its position. Animation is the perfect way to visually the behavior of these simulated birds as it allows the viewer to see the clustering and movements of the birds in general over time.\n\n\nShow code\nbirds_plot<-ggplot(all_birds2 %>% arrange(iteration) %>% filter(bird>0))+\n  # geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y,color=factor(bird),group=factor(bird),alpha=iteration))+\n  geom_spoke(aes(x=x,y=y,color=(bird),group=factor(bird),angle=a2),radius=1,arrow=arrow(type = \"closed\",length = unit(3/range,\"inches\")))+\n  guides(color='none')+\n  scale_color_viridis_b()+\n  coord_equal()+\n  transition_states(iteration)+\n  ease_aes(\"linear\")+\n  theme_void()+\n  # shadow_wake(wake_length = 1)+\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.title = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_blank())+\n  ggtitle(\"Moment {closest_state}\")\n\nanimate(birds_plot,nframes = iterations*2,duration = iterations/10,end_pause = 10,renderer = gifski_renderer())  \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can focus on the journey of one individual – the bird that starts farthest to the right.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the journey of all swifts at once."
